PLACEHOLDER: Replace this file with an actual firecracker.png image (64x64px recommended)

You can:
1. Create your own firecracker icon
2. Use a free icon from sites like:
   - https://www.flaticon.com/
   - https://icons8.com/
   - https://www.iconfinder.com/

Or create a simple SVG firecracker icon and convert it to PNG.

The game will still work without this image, but the firecracker icon in the HUD won't display.
