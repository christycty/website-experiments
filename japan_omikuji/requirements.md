Create an interactive website to simulate Japanese omikuji (fortune drawing in shrines).

Interaction Flow:
- should simulate the actual omikuji flow:
1. shake a cynlindrical box
2. a roll of paper slides out through a small hole
3. unfold the paper to show the omikuji.

Website Requirement
- it will be a static site hosted on github pages, so use Javascript libraries that do not require any installation like npm
- it should be modern, interactive and fancy (use you imagination!)
- make use of animations, 3D objects
